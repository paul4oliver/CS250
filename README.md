# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by understanding the functionality that will bring the most value and building features that meet those needs. Creating “user stories” helps with this by breaking down the who, what, and why at a level that outlines the functionality’s purpose so developers can more easily and accurately build them. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

I approach developing programs understanding it is an iterative process and being adaptive to clients’ needs is important for delivering a quality product. In my future development work, I hope to incorporate the Scrum-agile framework because I like the collaboration among team members and believe it can optimize their performance.    

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means taking ownership of your work, attending meetings, offering to help, and asking for help when needed. Using what you know to provide your best work and being open to learning more along the way are also qualities of a good team member in software development.
